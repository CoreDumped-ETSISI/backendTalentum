# backendTalentum
Backend software running only for Talentum2k17.

As can be seen, no node_modules are included. To use this software properly, running 'npm install' over the root directory of the project is required before trying to run it.

Moreover, it includes some toolkits, which allow the software to instantiate the API over the running machine by typing 'npm start'.
